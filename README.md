Continuous Delivery with Pulumi for Drone

## What is Pulumi

[Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)’s approach to infrastructure as code is great for continuous delivery, because it uses source code to model cloud resources. This means updates to your cloud infrastructure can be reviewed, validated, and tested using the same process that you have today. For example, doing code reviews via Pull Requests, running code through linters or static analysis tools, and running unit and integration tests as appropriate. It all “just works” for your cloud infrastructure the same way it would for your application code.
